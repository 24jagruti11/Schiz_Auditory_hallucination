# Functional Connectivity in Schizophrenia patients with and without Auditory Hallucinations**

# Summary: 
This project focuses on examining if there are differences in the functional connectivity in schizophrenia with and without auditory hallucinations as well as healthy controls during speech perception. 
The data (OpenNeuro) (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004302/versions/1.0.1). 
71 participants were divided into 3 groups, Schizophrenia patients a)**with** auditory hallucination (AVH+), b)**without** auditory hallucination (AVH-) and Healthy Controls (HC)
They did a speech perception task when they were in a fMRI scanner.
Our aim was to learn preprocessing and analysis of fMRI data and getting familiar with machine learning. 
## Project 

### Background
This project uses machine learning to look at functional connectivity in schizophrenia patients with and without auditory hallucination during speech perception.
The data used is available on OpenNeuro (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004302/versions/1.0.1)
Since the underlying cause of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia patients has not been found yet, we wanted to look at the functional connectivity of these individuals while they perform a speech perception task to examine the activity of different brain regions.

### Tools

The "project template" project will rely on the following technologies:
 * Downloading the data from OpenNeuro
 * SciNet teach cluster for the preprocessing of the data
 * Processing of fMRI data with nilearn

### Data

The data used is available on OpenNeuro (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004302/versions/1.0.1)

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we will have:
 - Git repository
 - Codescript

## Results

### Progress overview

The project involved importing data on a github repository, using SciNet teach cluster for the preprocessing of the data and parcellation. Preprocessing involved running MRIQC to generate quality metric report, fMRIPrep for preprocessing of the data, Ciftify Clean for signal cleaning and Ciftify for the visualisation of the data. Parcellation helped to divide brain regions based on brain activty where groups of similar voxels are averaged to reduce the effect of random noise effects.  **MACHINE LEARNING**
